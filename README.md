## Description

Movie-driven database in which users can register and login, therefore creating an account. Once inside, the user can choose from a select number of movies that will eventually after taking in the data, portray  similar results for their specific liking. Showing potential places one could watch said movie.

Deployment Errors: Github only grabs README, and when trying to use the site "render" I receive this message "warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json." Due to it using yarn. 


## Usage

The User must first install all frontend and backend requirements before officially starting the program usually consisted of: 
```md
npm i 'requirement'
```
then eventually to start on the frontend:
```md
npm start
```
or for the backend:
```md
node server.js
```
Which will then deploy the application using everything given to the User
