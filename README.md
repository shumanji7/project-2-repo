## Description

Movie-driven database in which users can register and login, therefore creating an account. Once inside, the user can choose from a select number of movies that will eventually after taking in the data, portray  similar results for their specific liking. (Potentially showing links to where one could watch, whilst also showing the iMDb score.)


## Usage

The User must first install all frontend and backend requirements before officially starting the program usually consisted of: 
```md
npm i 'requirement'
```
then eventually to start on the frontend:
```md
npm start
```
or for the backend:
```md
node server.js
```
Which will then deploy the application using everything given to the User
